    "bio":"Hi I'm Akbar a self taught, design thinking full-stack JavaScript developer with a passion for developing interactive websites. I'm currently living in Thane, Mumbai. I have a zeal to learn and implement latest technology stacks that helps an application achieve speed, security and scalablity.My focus for now is heavily in both frontend and backend web development. My favorite development stack at the moment is React, Node, MongoDB, Express, Spring. Values I hold high are loyalty, reliability, authenticity and helping other achieve their success. Which is why I see projects through to the end and why I believe in not only creating beautiful software but also reliable and reflect the client's brand and that is easy to use so that it does not distract user experience Whether itâ€™s creating servers in Node, connecting to MongoDB databases or designing unique user experiences through React per device whilst still maintaining a consistent brand experience, I can bring ideas to life.",
